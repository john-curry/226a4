Given a list of planets seperated by wormholes, use Euclidean distance to find the Shortest Path between all the planets. An Algorthms and Datastructures assignment

Uses Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm to find the shortest distance between all planets as well as the number of wormholes between planets.

The planets are represented by a Direct Graph
